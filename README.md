# javascript-challenge

In this challenge, I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.js to create a table dynamically and allow users to filter the table data for specific values. 
I wrote a code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting, using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects.
